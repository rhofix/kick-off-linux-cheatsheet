# Hi Buddy! If you are new to UNIX/Linux then you should have this handy!
# As a developer you are expected to play well in Unix/Linux environment as most of the production servers are Linux VMs. 
#
# To know more visit: https://ss64.com/bash/
# 
# System: Ubuntu LTS 16.04	       
#    
#	Fun Facts:
#	
#	 -> " . " in linux . represents current directory.
#	 -> Most of the time you have seen something like:
#	 -> Loopback access (access from 127.0.0.1) when you ping to localhost
#           !/bin/bash. At the top of any shell script. This is known as a Shebang line.
#	 -> Linux Commands are case sensitive.  ll is not same as LL!
#
#	This is a warm up file that helps you get warmed up before dealing with prod servers. Surely, It does not contain all 
#	Unix/linux commands for example curl, nohup, awk, patch, comm, sed and many others, which are equally important.

# Use the usermod command to add the user to the sudo group.

 usermod -aG sudo username
 
# Ownership

# You should use chown when you want a file's user or group permissions to apply to a different user or group.

# You create a file, myfile.txt, using sudo or while logged in as root, so the file is owned by root. However, you intend the file to be used by your regular user account, myuser.

 sudo chown myuser myfile.txt 
 
# You also want to change the owning group of that file to that user's group, notmygroup.

 sudo chown myuser:notmygroup myfile.txt

To do it recursively for all files inside a directory

sudo chown -R myuser:mygroup otherfiles


*****************************************
In Linux, a user can be a member of multiple groups, but it has only one "current group". The user's current group is the user's group identity, or GID.

When the user creates a new file, the file's ownership is set to the user's UID (user identity) and GID (group identity). So when user rdbagwe starts writing a new document, the file is owned by rdbagwe, and also by her current group. She can change the file's group ownership with chown, but only root can use chown to change the owner to someone else.

****************************************************************
Compress an Entire Directory or a Single File

Use the following command to compress an entire directory or a single file on Linux. It will also compress every other directory inside a directory you specify  in other words, it works recursively.

tar -czvf nameofarchive.tar.gz /path/to/directory-or-file to be archived 

Heres what those switches actually mean:

-c: Create an archive.
-z: Compress the archive with gzip.
-v: Display progress in the terminal while creating the archive, also known as verbose mode. The v is always optional in these commands, but its helpful.
-f: Allows you to specify the filename of the archive.

If you have a directory named data in the current directory and you want to save it to a file named archive.tar.gz , you would run the following command:
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz data

If you have a directory at /usr/local/something on the current system and you want to compress it to a file named archive.tar.gz , you would run the following command:

 
 tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /usr/local/something

 
****************************************************************
Extract an Archive

Once you have an archive, you can extract it with the tar command. The following command will extract the contents of archive.tar.gz to the current directory.

tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz

Its the same as the archive creation command we used above, except the -x switch replaces the -c switch. This specifies you want to extract an archive instead of create one.

The apt-get utility is a powerful and free package management command line program, that is used to work with Ubuntus APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) library to perform installation of new software packages, removing existing software packages, upgrading of existing software packages and even used to upgrading the entire operating system.


# To list all the available packages, type the following command.

 apt-cache pkgnames

#How Do I Install or Upgrade Specific Packages?
#The install sub command is tracked by one or more packages wish for installation or upgrading.

 sudo apt-get install netcat


#How Do I Completely Remove Packages
#To remove software packages including their configuration files, use the purge sub command as shown below.

 sudo apt-get purge vsftpd

# To un-install software packages without removing their configuration files (for later re-use the same configuration). Use the remove command as shown.

 sudo apt-get remove vsftpd


# How Do I Install Specific Package Version?
# Let's say you wish to install only specific version of packages, simply use the = with the package-name and append desired version.

 sudo apt-get install vsftpd=2.3.5-3ubuntu1


# How I Can Clean Up Disk Space
# The clean command is used to free up the disk space by cleaning retrieved (downloaded) .deb files (packages) from the local repository.

 sudo apt-get clean


# How I Can Auto clean Apt-Get Cache?
# The autoclean command deletes all .deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives to free-up significant volume of disk space.
	
 sudo apt-get autoclean

Packages are manually installed via the dpkg command (Debian Package Management System). dpkg is the backend to commands like apt-get and aptitude

But of course the easiest ways to install a package would be, first, the GUI apps (Synaptic, Software Center, etc..), followed by the terminal commands apt-get and aptitude that add a very nice user friendly approach to the backend dpkg

 sudo dpkg -i DEB_PACKAGE
 sudo dpkg -i askubuntu_2.0.deb

# Remove a package
 
 sudo dpkg -r askubuntu

# List all installed packages.
# You can pipe the command to less (a pager) so you can more easily scroll the content:

 dpkg -l | less

# Check if the package is installed or not, and if it is, launch it:
 
 dpkg -l | vlc


# If dpkg reports an error due to dependency problems, you can run sudo apt-get install -f to download the missing dependencies and configure everything.

Linux administration: iptables
		     
################

- Setting up a good firewall is an essential step to take in securing any modern operating system. 

- Iptables is the software firewall that is included with most Linux distributions by default (a modern variant called nftables will begin to replace it).

- can manipulate the Linux network stack, to block unwanted traffic

-  The netfilter firewall that is included in the Linux kernel keeps IPv4 and IPv6 traffic completely separate. In Linux, IPv6 security 	is maintained separately from IPv4.
	"iptables" only maintains firewall rules for IPv4 addresses but it has an IPv6 counterpart called "ip6tables", which 			can be used to maintain firewall rules for IPv6 network addresses. 


- A chain is a set of rules that a packet is checked against sequentially.

- There are three chains defined by default. They are:

INPUT: This chain handles all packets that are addressed to your server.

OUTPUT: This chain contains rules for traffic created by your server.

FORWARD: This chain is used to deal with traffic destined for other servers that are not created on your server.
This chain is basically a way to configure your server to route requests to other machines.


-  Keep in mind that the order of your rules matter. All of these iptables commands use the -A option to append the new rule to the end of a chain. 
If you want to put it somewhere else in the chain, you can use the -I option which allows you to specify the position of the new rule (or simply place it at the beginning of the chain by not specifying a rule number)
	
	-A # to append rules
	-s # source
	-p #specifies the protocol
	-P #chain name OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD
	-j # defines the target action 

Basic iptables Commands:
 
  sudo iptables -L  # to list the current rules that are configured for iptables
  
  sudo ip6tables -L
 
  sudo iptables -F	# to flush the current rules that are configured for iptables 

Block an IP Address:

  sudo iptables -A INPUT -s IP_ADDRRSS -j DROP
  
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -s IP_ADDRRSS -j REJECT  #which will respond to the connection request with a "connection refused" error
  
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -j DROP #block TCP traffic
  
  sudo iptables-save > $HOME/firewall.txt #to save firewall rules for ipv4
  
  sudo iptables-restore < $HOME/firewall.txt #restore the rules
  
  sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport xxx -j DROP # block outgoing connections on a specific port
  
  sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport xxx -j ACCEPT # Allow outgoing connections on a specific port
  
  # multiport can also be used

Ubuntu
On Ubuntu, the easiest way to save iptables rules, so they will survive a reboot, is to use the iptables-persistent package. 

 sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
 
# During the installation, you will asked if you want to save your current firewall rules.

# If you update your firewall rules and want to save the changes, run this command:

 sudo netfilter-persistent save #16.04

 sudo invoke-rc.d iptables-persistent save #prior to 16.04




# Managing Firewall on Ubuntu

 ufw  # command is used for managing a Linux firewall
 
 # enable/disable on boot
 
 sudo ufw status
 
 sudo ufw disable
 
 sudo ufw enable
 
 sudo ufw reload
 
 #find process on port

sudo service apache2 start VS. sudo systemctl start apache2

> service operates on the files in /etc/init.d and was used in conjunction with the old init system. systemctl operates on the files in /lib/systemd . If there is a file for your service in /lib/systemd it will use that first and if not it will fall back to the file in /etc/init.d. Also If you are using OS like ubuntu-14.04 only service command will be available.

-- When we create a user using useradd function user ID will be assigned to the user reading /etc/login.defs files. You can also create a new user with specific user id by using -u option with useradd command:

> To create a user with User ID 1401 you can run following command in the terminal:

useradd -u 1401 demouser1
 

> Confirm and verify User ID with id command:

id -u demouser1

> to create a user with home directory use -m option, or assign to group use -g option 

> To see the user home directory and other user related information like user id, group id, shell and comments
